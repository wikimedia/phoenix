## Goal
Explore emerging patterns for building systems that manage and distribute content<sup>[[1]](#ref1)</sup>.

The jump from wiki software to modern web architecture (for example, a [reactive](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) system) is huge and difficult to conceptualize. Experimenting with core patterns enables us to gain insight into the possibilities and potential impossibilities.

## Primary focus
**Canonical data modeling**<sup>[[2]](#ref2)</sup><sup>[[3]](#ref3)</sup> allows content to be understood by people, programs and machines outside the traditional boundaries of MediaWiki. And, as far as possible, allows consumers<sup>[[4]](#ref4)</sup> to request only what they need.

Building this model requires defining boundaries around parts and their interrelationships. For example, a page has parts (sections) and is also part of collections (about the same topic). Our work here includes:

- Define a predictable structure<sup>[[5]](#ref5)</sup> using industry-standard formats like schema.org (to support predictability and reusability)
- Break down prexisting structures (all the content on the Philadephia page) into parts (a section on the History of Philadephia) and establish interrelationships between the parts (to support "only what they need") using hypermedia linking.<sup>[[6]](#ref6)</sup>
- Enhance the structure with contextual information by associating parts with Wikidata (to enable natural collections like US Cities) and indexing collections with [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch).
- Enable interaction with the structure via [API calls](https://graphql.org/). Multiple API calls can be wrapped into a single payload -- or not.

*Note: Honestly, we don't know if it's humanly possible to "structure" Wikipedia documents. We are identifying the Biggest Challenges so we can raise them and resolve them organizationally.* 

## Secondary focus

**Loose coupling:**<sup>[[7]](#ref7)</sup> New ways to interact with, enhance or process content (capabilities) operate independently and are built on top of (or adjacent to) the data model.

**Event-based interactions:**<sup>[[8]](#ref8)</sup> activities in the system happen only when they need to happen (asynchronously) with only the information they need to accomplish their aim.

**CQRS**:<sup>[[9]](#ref9)</sup> The current structure inside of MediaWiki is left alone. When changes happen in MW, the new system reacts by getting the necessary information and translating it into the canonical data model.

[Initial Model of how this works](https://app.lucidchart.com/documents/view/f283e649-cdb6-4275-9452-7114571a82e7/Q3nNnx6PpfFM)

## Implementation
We have purposefully defined the implementation toolset for this PoV. We did this so we can focus on the patterns, which present signification challenges, *before deciding which are valuable long term.* By working in AWS, we don't need to build that toolset.

Our next step is not to put this exact toolset into production. Our next step is to collectively design an infrastructure that supports the value while also considering the tradeoffs.

## What about editing?
We are beginning to model editing events now. This approach is designed to work *with* any CMS, as part of a system, not replace it. We will be carefully thinking through which patterns apply, which don't, and which need to be included that aren't here.

## Upcoming use case
We've modeled a number of use cases, some in partnership with the Structured Data Across Wikipedia team, that will benefit from these patterns. When our initial work is complete, we will be prototyping with the Mobile team, specifically focused on References.

### Configure AWS environmetn

* Create  `.\env\env.mk` file. You may use prepared template: `.\env\env.mk.tlp` for that. Say, by run command in terminal:  
```cp .\env\env.mk.tlp .\env\env.mk```

* Fill the following fields in created file:
  - PHX_ACCOUNT_ID = `<Your AWS account id>`
  - PHX_DEFAULT_REGION = `<AWS region you want to deploy env in>`
  - PHX_PREFIX = `<Prefix to be added to all your resource names not to intersect with other deployed instances>`
